Yes, it works fine. HAL just pops up on resume and forcibly removes the card!

Tested 128MB MMC and 512MB SD. All suspend resume is hunky dory with rev86.

I now can't fault it..
That card slot was the only driver on the whole machine that was my bugbear. It is no longer.

On a related note, being a Sony laptop it has a memory stick pro slot also. I don't own any sony 
memory sticks and have no devices that used them (bloody proprietary crap if you ask me), but when 
it comes time to test I have a cost effective source for them over here, so I can test that too if 
you like.

I'm so tempted to go and pick up a high speed 4G SDHC card now to see if that needs work also, but 
not just yet. Too busy basking in the glow of a working reader with the cards I have!

I did not apply the patch you sent against rev85 to help mmc detection, but I've not seen the mmc 
problem reoccur yet either.
