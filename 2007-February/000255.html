I'm not sure.. I can't get the cards to detect reliably (read as it worked briefly once after my 
last hal upgrade but I had the /dev/mmc(x) in /etc/fstab so I don't know if it's that which caused 
gnome to pop up the window). In any case, I'll leave the hal debugging until I can at least plug a 
card in and have it reliably detect.

&gt;<i> 2. I've found a data corruption under certain write scenarious. This may explain some symptoms.

Excellent.

&gt;<i> 3. Bad hardware state - it is not very probable at this point. If controller talks to cards at all
</I>&gt;<i> (it appears so in your earlier log) then hardware is ok.
</I>
It's completely bizzare. Very occasionally when I insert a card, it will properly detect and create 
the device nodes, but mostly it just does what all the logs indicate. This is my greatest 
frustration right now as I can't even read/write test the cards.


&gt;<i> By the way, you may want to re-format your cards on a known good configuration (the fat is
</I>&gt;<i> probably corrupted in some bizarre way).
</I>
Ok.. I need to find some way to get the data off these cards, reformat them and get the data back on 
again then. Might have to go and buy a usb card reader. :(

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, of course, the whole thing is quite frustrating for me too. There's no documentation
</I>&gt;<i> whatsoever for these controllers - the only reference I have is a disassembly of the windows
</I>&gt;<i> driver.
</I>
Yep, I can understand that. Worse still, I guess you never see what I see so making it impossible to 
really test locally, combined with our obviously disparate timezones. Do you use irc at all?
