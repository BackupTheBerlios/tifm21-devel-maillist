Fair enough too.. I find it good using freenode to interact with developers when I'm abusing their 
software :)

&gt;<i> Anyway, I think I've found the problem.

</I>
I'm not so sure about that from what I've seen. I have a script I use to unload the tifm modules and 
it also unloads mmc_block and mmc_core, then checks to make *sure* they are unloaded and complains 
*loudly* if they fail to unload. I've not seen mmc_block getting stuck.

The last mail I sent titled &quot;New logs with freshly formatted cards&quot; are 4 insertion logs using 3 
different cards and done after a clean boot and module load, so mmc_block never even gets 
referenced. Still just having basic issues recognising the card.

&gt;<i> 2. Write corruption - new version of tifm_sd attached (rev 81 in SVN).
</I>
Will give this a whirl right now and see how we go.
