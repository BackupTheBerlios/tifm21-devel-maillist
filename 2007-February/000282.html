Revision 85 works perfectly! A big thanks to both of you.

I tried reading with a 16MB MMC card and with a 512MB SD card. With the
SD card, I transferd 293MB of data in just under 40 sec (wall clock
time), so that would be around 7.3 MB/s. Since that was done in
nautilus, maybe it had already cached a few files, I don't know.

All in all these perfs look really good. This was done on a 2.6.20
kernel with the gentoo patchset, fyi. HAL integration and detection is
perfect, the icon popped on my desktop in less than a sec.

I don't know if it's too late yet, but you should definitely try to push
this revision into the kernel.

Cheers :)

R&#233;mi
