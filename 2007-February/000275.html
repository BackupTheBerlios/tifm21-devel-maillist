But of course.. at least we've developed to a point where I think I know how to feed you debug data 
in some form of useful format.. so bring 'em on..

&gt;<i> To my understanding, the driver runs at maximum speed now - no more speed improvements expected.
</I>&gt;<i> The theoretical maximum both for current mmc cards and the adapter is around 12 MB/s, but I'm

</I>&gt;<i> field in card's CSD register for this value and I've never seen values other than 4. 
</I>
6MB/s is faster than I had expected..

&gt;<i> There are two more items worth checking, however:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. no_dma=1 option - it works for me, does it for you? (it's supposed to be much slower than dma
</I>&gt;<i> mode, but I've implemented it just in case)
</I>
Ok, I'll give this a bash.. rev83 died horribly when I tried it, but I'll try it with the current 
driver with all cards.

&gt;<i> 2. suspend/resume (currently broken) - planned for rev 85 in a couple of days
</I>
Happy to test this.. I currently unload prior to suspend and reload post resume, so suspend testing 
is certainly something I want to do.

&gt;<i> I hope you don't mind if I'll put an attribution to your effort in the driver's code? After all,
</I>&gt;<i> you're doing a great QA job on this thing.
</I>
No problem at all, happy to help where I can anyway.
