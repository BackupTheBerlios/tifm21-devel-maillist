</I>&gt;<i> Logs from a 128MB MMC (no recognise again) and a 2G SD which at least is now recognised each

</I>&gt;<i> The 1st time I insert the SD card, HAL picks it up, mounts it and everything goes nicely. After
</I>&gt;<i> it 
</I>&gt;<i> explodes the 1st time it gets ugly from there.
</I>&gt;<i>

We are looking at two different problems here:
1. MMC card just does not works. This can be problem with clock, voltage (I have no idea how to
set it to anything other than default) or it may be a real timeout. The last point can be tested
by changing this line in tifm_sd:
----
// command timeout fixed to 64 clocks for now
writel(64, sock-&gt;addr + SOCK_MMCSD_COMMAND_TO);
----
(put a larger value instead of 64, say 128).
I must also ask - had this MMC card ever worked before on linux? And if yes, on what
configuration?

2. The SD card does nothing wrong as far as I can see. It simply gets ejected without provocation:
----
[  375.310000] tifm_7xx1 0000:06:05.3: checking media set 8
[  375.310000] tifm_7xx1: demand removing card from socket 0:3
----
This is more or less clear cut hardware problem. Most probably something with power.
We can try the following:
Add this printout to tifm_sd_ios:

--------------------------------

Then, I may need a log where card fails, you get it out and then put back in - may be we'll be
able to nail the particular problem.

I still believe that the ugly parts are not my fault, so to say. It seems like some problem in
block layer (mmc_block or above) is triggered by sudden death of the block device. We can do an
experiment: say card failed, you plugged it out/in and nothing gets detected. From my experience,
main block device gets created by udev (/dev/mmcblk0 or any other number), but partition table is
not read. You can test this by running &quot;cfdisk&quot; on the /dev/mmcblk0 to make sure that reading
indeed works (cfdisk will display the correct partition table and no errors will be reported).
