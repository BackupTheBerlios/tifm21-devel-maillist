Suspend/Resume (To disk and S3) with no card inserted : Great!

Suspend/Resume (To disk and S3) with card inserted : Great!, stays mounted and all read/write is 
good. Not sure I want to try suspending mid-write, but I'll get to that a bit later when I have time.

Insert Card, Suspend, Remove Card, Resume : Dies and can't get a trace.

I inserted a card, suspended to disk, removed the card, tried to resume and it hung up.
Rebooted with Alt-sysrq-B and re-inserted the card before attempting to resume again and it resumed 
nicely and I can still access the card.

So it works unless you remove the card while it's out cold, in which case it explodes on resume.

That's pretty impressive progress for one revision!
