Comrade I'm afraid I have no logs to report.

It's passed slightly harder than cursory testing on
128MB MMC
512MB SD
2GB SD
2GB SD (the one you said was SDHC)

The MMC read/write speed is somewhere around 1.5MB/S, the SD read/write speeds are somewhere between 
4 &amp; 6MB/s consistently. (Oh, that's with debugging turned off, with debug on it drops by 1-1.5MB/s)

I've not tried *hard* to break it yet, but it's passed all the tests I've managed to blow it up with 
previously.

I might pick up a card I don't mind killing and run bonnie on it or something, but my usual &quot;queue 
up 100MB of files then sync it all at once&quot; passes with flying colours, as do all the rsync checksum 
tests on the written files and media fsck's ..

It's looking a lot better than it has been ;)

Nice work!

Ok, I'll include one bit of log just for the hell of it.. this is a snip of dmesg | grep dma
