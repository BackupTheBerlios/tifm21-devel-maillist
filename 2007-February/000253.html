<PRE>G'day Alex,

This is perhaps an interesting log..

Clean(ish) boot. No suspend/resume.

Insert card and is detected (my shiny new hal detects it, mounts it and pops up a window for it)

I rsync some data to the card and it dies.

Pull the card, manually unmount

try re-inserting the card. No go.

unload/reload modules and try several more insertions, no go..

So this is a continuous log. 1st one is a success, I can read the card. When I write to it, it dies 
horribly. This may be related to the SDHC thing, but after this happens once I can no longer get a 
card to detect properly. Even suspend/resume or cold boot I have trouble getting a card detected, 
it's almost like the hardware is being left in an odd state. If I leave it powered off for 20 mins 
or so it usually works.

log is 27k b2zipped and 2M uncompressed. I've snipped most of the irrelevant stuff.
Hope this helps. It's 2.6.20-git4 + the patch you sent me + the patch from the mmc git tree you 
pointed me at.

Brad
