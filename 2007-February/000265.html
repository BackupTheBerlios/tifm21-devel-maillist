Using vanilla 2.6.20 kernel and rev82 MMC and SD detection is now reliable.
It still blows up writing to the card though, trying to get some form of usable log for you.

(cc'd Pierre Ossman for hal issues)

Found the issue with HAL also. If a card is forcibly removed while mounted, HAL is not removing it 
from the device tree, so next time a card is inserted HAL just sits on it's backside. (This used to 
work). Pierre I've got CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y at the moment, but it does not seem to matter.

If I properly unmount the card prior to the eject, then it is properly removed from the HAL device 
tree and HAL works on the next insert. Something to do with the card still being mounted before the 
sysfs entries are removed. Not sure how to debug further yet.

Attached is a log of the 128MB MMC card. Insert, copy some data (6MB of mp3's), umount from desktop 
- which forces a sync - *boom*. Alex, this card was freshly formatted FAT16 (formatted in my camera)

I think this is where it goes pear shaped..

I'm trying to get my hands on a non-SDHC SD card for testing, at the moment the MMC is all I have as 
the other 2G cards appear to be SDHC
