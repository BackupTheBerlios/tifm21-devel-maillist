<PRE>G'day Alex,

I'm having issues writing large amounts of data to SD cards.

I have had absolutely no issues reading from any of my cards any amount of data, and I can write 
small chunks at a time, like creating directories and small test files, but when I try and copy a 
directory of about 150MB in 20 files, I get the following log.

I've tried this on a Sandisk 2.0GB, HP 2GB and Panasonic 512MB card, same result every time.

I also downloaded the latest SVN driver and beat it to work &quot;for certain definitions of work&quot; on a 
2.6.20-rc7 kernel and the 2.6.19 kernel, and it appears to give the same result, but then I may have 
bent it a little far to make it fit.

What kernel is the SVN driver currently compiling against and what information can I offer to assist 
in debugging this ? (Got a bit of time and a couple of test cards available)

Controller is
0000:06:05.3 Mass storage controller: Texas Instruments PCIxx21 Integrated FlashMedia Controller
In a Sony VAIO VGN-TX27GP.

Kernel currently is
Linux bklaptop2 2.6.19-rc6-git8-bkc1 #3 Thu Feb 1 16:17:23 GST 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
But I've tried with 2.6.19.2 2.6.20-rc7 &amp; -rc7-git1, both in-tree drivers and latest SVN

&lt;heaps and heaps of these repeated&gt;

I recall having this working at some point with an earlier SVN driver prior to it being included in 
the mainline kernel.

Regards,
Brad
