Passed no_dma=1 with flying colours for all SD and MMC cards. Read/write speed down to ~700k-1M/s

Noticed a small quirk. Sometimes I have to insert the MMC card twice to get it to recognise the 
card. Easy to spot, on first insert the led just blinks once quickly and then nothing. 
Remove/re-insert and it picks it up the next time round. Might be timing related, but it's hard to 
reproduce and always works the second time. SD recognition is always rock solid.

I've done some heavier testing and I can't fault it *yet* ;)
