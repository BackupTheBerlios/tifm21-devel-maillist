</I>&gt;<i> (put a larger value instead of 64, say 128).
</I>&gt;<i> I must also ask - had this MMC card ever worked before on linux? And if yes, on what
</I>&gt;<i> configuration?
</I>
Yes.. I used it yesterday with this inbuilt reader and a 2.6.19 kernel using the integrated tifm 
driver. In fact, I wrote about 80MB to the card, the did a full verify on it. At 172kb/s mind you, 
but none the less it worked.

&gt;<i> 2. The SD card does nothing wrong as far as I can see. It simply gets ejected without provocation:
</I>&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;<i> [  375.310000] tifm_7xx1 0000:06:05.3: checking media set 8
</I>&gt;<i> [  375.310000] tifm_7xx1: demand removing card from socket 0:3
</I>
That line is where *I* pulled the card out after it exploded..

The snippet below is where it all goes pear shaped during the write.

[  266.740000] tifm_sd tifm_sd0:3: host_status 1, fifo_status 0
[  266.750000] tifm_sd tifm_sd0:3: host_status 8, fifo_status 0
[  266.750000] tifm_sd tifm_sd0:3: host_status 0, fifo_status 1
[  267.740000] tifm_sd: card failed to respond for a long period of time
[  267.740000] tifm_7xx1 0000:06:05.3: checking media set 8
[  267.740000] tifm_7xx1: demand removing card from socket 0:3

Notice the card removal here? The card was untouched and still in the socket.

[  267.740000] tifm_sd tifm_sd0:3: w_bl 0, num_bl 0, b_s 512, bsh 1

&gt;<i> This is more or less clear cut hardware problem. Most probably something with power.

</I>&gt;<i> able to nail the particular problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still believe that the ugly parts are not my fault, so to say. It seems like some problem in
</I>&gt;<i> block layer (mmc_block or above) is triggered by sudden death of the block device. We can do an
</I>&gt;<i> experiment: say card failed, you plugged it out/in and nothing gets detected. From my experience,
</I>&gt;<i> main block device gets created by udev (/dev/mmcblk0 or any other number), but partition table is
</I>&gt;<i> not read. You can test this by running &quot;cfdisk&quot; on the /dev/mmcblk0 to make sure that reading
</I>&gt;<i> indeed works (cfdisk will display the correct partition table and no errors will be reported).
</I>
Will patch it up and run some tests this afternoon.

I really appreciate the help, hope we can nail it.
