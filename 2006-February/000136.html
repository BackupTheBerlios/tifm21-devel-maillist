There's already plenty of drivers that speak to multiple subsystems :) 
But more reasonably, integration with the MMC layer isn't hard - a 
typical MMC/SD driver just has to:

1) Set the hardware capabilities
2) Register some callbacks (one to receive information from the MMC 
system, one to perform MMC requests and one to check whether the card is 
read-only or not)
3) Be able to set the MMC hardware up as the MMC layer requests

That way you benefit from any improvements in the MMC protocol stack 
without having to implement them again. There's a strong shift in the 
kernel towards using generic protocol stacks and fairly thin drivers - 
see the discussion about adopting an 802.11 stack rather than leaving 
one in every wireless driver, for instance.

For the xD and MS stuff, there's much less of an argument at the moment. 
We don't have anything in the kernel that drives them.
