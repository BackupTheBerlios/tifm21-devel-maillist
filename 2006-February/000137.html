<PRE>hi!

i wrote a message to the ethics department of texas instruments (<A HREF="http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/citizen/ethics/conduct.shtml">http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/citizen/ethics/conduct.shtml</A>) regarding to the (non)GPL binary driver from texas instruments. they responded with the message below; a answer from the technics support sender gaves the more or less same content. so, if this driver is really from TI, we'd need the sender of this driver from TI to track this issue. the driver was sent to Cristopher Baker, right?


bye...masc.

Texas Instruments at this time does not have any plans to release a Linux
driver for this chipset or provide the source code so that others may
write drivers. OEM's that manufacture devices based on the ACX100 must
sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) and abide by the terms of this
agreement regarding driver support. TI will continue to monitor inquiries
regarding Linux driver requests for the ACX100 and in the future may
change its stance on driver support.

Thank You,

Karen Fischer

Hello, TI support,

**** Warning - this emailed link looks suspicious to me.  Is it a virus
scam?   DR ********

This inquiry was received in the ethics office hotline, but not via the
Accounting and Audit Hotline.

Would you be able to help Mr. Schneebacher?   I don't think this is a TI
product question.

The Linux question may need to be directed elsewhere.

Please let me know when this has been resolved. I will close my case on
it.  A copy of a final email exchange with the inquirer would be
sufficient for my files. Thanks again.



Regards, DR
Director, TI Ethics and Compliance

Subject: linux driver for the PCIxx21 flashmedia controller

hello!

i'm owning a notebook with the PCIxx21 integrated
pcmcia/firewire/flashmedia/SD controller, and i like to use it.
please could you send me (or provide it via your home page) the source
code of your linux driver for the flash media controller?

please note, as you provide the binary driver under the gpl and you are
including gpl code (at least include/linux/bio.h from the linux
sources), you should provide the source code (GPL licence, par. 3).
also, concerning the GPL par. 6 you should include the licence with your
binary driver too.


filename: tifm.ko
license: GPL
vermagic: 2.6.11.6 preempt PENTIUMM gcc-3.3
depends:
alias: pci:v0000104Cd0000AC8Fsv*sd*bc*sc*i*
alias: pci:v0000104Cd00008033sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
parm: major_num:int

(as i don't want to increase the size of the email, i put the driver on
my private site: <A HREF="http://zorn.mur.at/masc/ti-binary-driver.tgz">http://zorn.mur.at/masc/ti-binary-driver.tgz</A> )

thanks for your help,
...martin.schneebacher.
