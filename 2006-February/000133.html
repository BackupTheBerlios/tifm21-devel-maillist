Interesting. All the hardware I've seen with the controller has had the 
sdhci function visible at all times. What sort of machine do you have?

Using the generic mmc code means that any improvements in there 
automatically apply to the TI driver - there's recently been code added 
for MMCv4 support, and there are some patches for supporting the MMC 
password specification. However, as you suggest it doesn't provide 
anything terribly useful for MS or xD. Ideally we'd have separate 
protocol stacks for those as well, just in case anyone figures out how 
to drive any other controllers, but I can imagine that that's not a 
short-term goal.
