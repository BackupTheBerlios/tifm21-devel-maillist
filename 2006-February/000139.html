<PRE>hi!

the first response i forwarded to this mailing list seemed to be a fault of TI, because they were responding for the ACX100 (see it to late), so i pointed to this wrong hardware and asked (again) for the sources of the flashcard driver. this was their answer:

  Thank you for contacting Texas Instruments Technical Support. Your email
has been received and a Service Request# 1-234882985 has been assigned to
your inquiry.


TI does not develop Card &amp; Socket Services drivers for the TI PC Card
Controllers.

Our devices are used in many PC's and add-in cards from many
manufacturers. These manufacturers include PCI drivers from Microsoft
Corporation that enable the PCI card from TI. Texas Instruments does not
provide drivers for our PCI card for Windows or any other OS. If you are
encountering difficulties with the PCI port on your PC or add-in card,
please contact the manufacturer for support. Texas Instruments does not
provide any support for these end products.

Additional information

To find the manufacturer of the card, use the FCC's web page
<A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid/">http://www.fcc.gov/oet/fccid/</A> to search for the FCC ID number printed on
the bottom of the card. If it came preinstalled, please contact the store
where you purchased the computer.

Third-party vendors have developed C&amp;SS driver support for other
operating systems. These vendors include Phoenix, System Soft, and Award:

Microsoft www.microsoft.com 800-426-9400

Award Software/Phoenix Technologies www.phoenix.com 800-677-7305

Systemsoft Corp. www.systemsoft.com 800-796-0088

</I>&gt;<i> Texas Instruments at this time does not have any plans to release a

&gt;<i> driver for this chipset or provide the source code so that others may
</I>&gt;<i> write drivers. OEM's that manufacture devices based on the ACX100 must

&gt;<i> regarding Linux driver requests for the ACX100 and in the future may
</I>&gt;<i> change its stance on driver support.

i haven't asked for the driver/source of the ACX100, but for the PCIxx21
flashmedia/sd integrated controller series.
