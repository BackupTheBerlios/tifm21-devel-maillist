Good job. Yes, I think it'll be difficult and it's unlikely that this will
succeed. I'm getting in touch with EFF. But I think it's worth a try to
politely asking them for the source, before.

About disassembling, did he get those with an EULA? This would be quite
ridicolous, actually. Anyway, I think we are now absolutely free to do
what we want with that binary, so it makes no sense at all to split the
project. A quick objdump -d on it shows they didn't stripped function
names. (It was compiled with GCC: (GNU) 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-8) =)

They did even included:
include/linux/blkdev.h
include/linux/bio.h
