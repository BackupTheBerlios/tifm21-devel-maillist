<PRE>&gt;<i> Good job. Yes, I think it'll be difficult and it's unlikely that this will
</I>&gt;<i> succeed. I'm getting in touch with EFF. But I think it's worth a try to
</I>&gt;<i> politely asking them for the source, before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About disassembling, did he get those with an EULA? This would be quite
</I>&gt;<i> ridicolous, actually. Anyway, I think we are now absolutely free to do
</I>&gt;<i> what we want with that binary, so it makes no sense at all to split the
</I>&gt;<i> project. A quick objdump -d on it shows they didn't stripped function
</I>&gt;<i> names. (It was compiled with GCC: (GNU) 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-8) =)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They did even included:
</I>&gt;<i> include/linux/blkdev.h
</I>&gt;<i> include/linux/bio.h
</I>
This is good. Thanks to all involved.

I'm amazed anyone managed to get anything from TI. I've been trying to
illicit a response from both TI and Everest for months now and have
had no luck aside from an initial, next-day reply from TI saying &quot;Ask
Everest&quot;. Despite their rapid response, it was less than helpful, not
to mention rather insulting as it was a blatent copy of a forum post
regarding the driver that I had actually made myself.

On the supplied binary, I havent had a chance to test it yet, but my
understanding from both everest's site and other sources is that
Everests device driver does not create a standard block device and
consequently requires a daemon to work.

One thing to note: modinfo tifm.ko says that the license on the driver
is GPL. I'm not an expert, but doesn't that mean that someone has to
release the source code that was used to make that particular driver
somewhere?

Regardless, as we now have &quot;viable&quot; linux drivers as a reference, I
can drop my attempts at the decompilation of the windows version. I
was fumbling in the dark anyway, since assembly is not my thing
(hadn't done any since the MC68HC11 in Intro to Microprocessors at
uni).
