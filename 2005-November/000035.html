Perfect.

&gt;<i> Stefano, regarding your assistance, are you looking to help with the
</I>&gt;<i> reverse assembly and documentation or the development side of the
</I>&gt;<i> project? Also, since I will not be able to contribute code for this
</I>&gt;<i> project, I would also like to assist with your Broadcom project, as my

</I>
I'm willing to help on the development side, as I don't have any
experience of reverse engineering. About the Broadcom project, you can
join the development mailing list and see the current code in the svn
repository, both things are linked from <A HREF="http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/.">http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/.</A> If you
want to help out with reverse engineering, you should join the irc channel
#bcm-specs at irc.sipsolutions.net (port 1994 for ssl).

&gt;<i> Another thought is if we're going to seperate the development of the
</I>&gt;<i> driver this way, it might be possible for someone involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation side of the project to sign an NDA with TI in exchange
</I>&gt;<i> for proper documentation perhaps.
</I>
I already thought about this and tried contacting TI, but I got no useful
results so far.
