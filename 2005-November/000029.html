<PRE>I'm very interested about this project, and I'm willing to help. But I
think there are some urgent legal issues going up with the driver
development. I already had to deal with this - I'm a developer from the
bcm43xx Linux Driver project - this way I understood how it's important
not to overlook legal issues in these cases.

Here goes the matter, this is pasted from a random EULA the windows driver
is distributed under:

3. Reverse Engineering. You agree that you will not attempt, and if you
employ employees or engage contractors, you will use your best efforts to
prevent your employees and contractors from attempting to reverse compile,
reverse engineer, modify, translate or disassemble the Software in whole
or in part. Any failure to comply with the above or any other terms and
conditions contained herein will result in the automatic termination of
this license and the reversion of the rights granted hereunder to TAIS.

Who distributes this software (e.g. Toshiba) could (and very probably
will) sue you as you have infringed this clause.

We solved this with cleanroom approach, more information about can be
found here:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design</A>

I propose that the tifm21 project will just deal with the driver
development, and people who is interested in reverse engineering:
1) immediately stops contributing to the project (no code, no problem)
2) unsubscribe from this project and stops accessing to any repository
3) open a new project elsewhere (on berlios, too) with a different name
(e.g. tifm21-specs), dealing with _documentation_ about the device, which
can come from disassembling, testing, anything you want.

The tifm21 project will then write code based on these specifications.

If you accept my proposal, I'll join this project. I know that it can
sound quite weird, I come here and say you must split the project, but I
really think this is required for further development. As a matter of
fact, Broadcom is monitoring closely our project
(<A HREF="http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/">http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/</A>) progress. Evidence of this is they removed
some features from the driver that were exploited by reverse engineers
(<A HREF="http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net">http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net</A>) in order to understand their code. I
think that with TI thinks can get even worse, so please fix this issue
while you can, not any later.
