<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; The tifm21 project will then write code based on these specifications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i agree with this proposal
</I>&gt;<i> i'm going to take the following steps, if everybody involved agrees:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) remove from the project any people involved with reverse engineering
</I>&gt;<i> 2) remove from project pages any reference, even not direct ones, about
</I>&gt;<i> reverse engineered code
</I>&gt;<i> 3) publish, as soon as somebody creates it, a link to the new
</I>&gt;<i> documentation project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i hope people who have helped out with reverse engineering will create a
</I>&gt;<i> new project so that the driver development can go on
</I>
I agree that this is probably an issue and am willing to submit to it.
The code I have provided on the project thus far is completely
independant of my reverse engineering attempts and does nothing more
than enable the device on the PCI bus and write to PCI registers
documented in the datasheets freely available on Texas Instruments
website.

As I have been looking at the assembly code in an attempt to identify
how to actually use the device, I am probably considered tainted by my
experiences, and shall remove myself from the tifm21 project. I
believe all files related to the reverse engineering of the driver
have already been removed from berlios, and I have also removed the
same files from another personal site that I was using for storage.

Stefano, regarding your assistance, are you looking to help with the
reverse assembly and documentation or the development side of the
project? Also, since I will not be able to contribute code for this
project, I would also like to assist with your Broadcom project, as my
laptop also contains one of these chips.

Another thought is if we're going to seperate the development of the
driver this way, it might be possible for someone involved in the
documentation side of the project to sign an NDA with TI in exchange
for proper documentation perhaps.
