Congrats.

Now, I don't think it makes sense to keep two separate projects for the
same thing. You are the only one working on it, and this confusion doesn't
help when it comes to possible collaboration. Paul Webster and Ian Morgan
had started writing code some time ago, e.g. I think what makes more sense
is merging the two projects. Which doesn't mean merging the code, IMHO, as
yours looks a very good starting point, and maybe something more than a
starting point. It means closing the tifm21 project and opening a new
mailing list related to the tifmxx project. It's up to you, giskard and
Paul Webster, i guess.

But I don't agree with some of the things you state on the wiki. Yes, in a
free world, reverse engineering wouldn't even be needed. I don't think we
live in a free world. See the Sklyarov case. Cleanroom approach is just a
method to avoid companies suing you. I'm collaborating at the bcm43xx
driver project following this method, not because I like it (even if it
works), but because I don't feel like Broadcom sue me. Even Compaq did
this with the IBM PC bios, BTW.

Plus, I guess you are just using the binary Linux driver for reverse
engineering purposes. That's GPL'ed, and it's not a problem at all to keep
it into the trunk. Reverse engineering it is legal, and what's not legal is
that TI doesn't release the source for it. But I can't understand why
you committed into trunk the windows binary driver. This is absolutely
useless and could lead to legal issues. Why?

I hope Jens Axboe will successfully pursue TI for the GPL violation. But,
as we all know, this is going to be very difficult.
