<PRE>Hi to all.

I just bought a Toshiba Satellite M70-142 that has a 3-in-1 card reader from 
TI.
I just reached the Berlios.de project page searching for a driver that could 
enable this interface (that works flawlessly under Windows XP HE).

I tried to use the binary driver &quot;provided&quot; by Texas Instruments but it is 
unusable under SuSE 10 (it is compiled with gcc 3.x, SuSE 10 kernel is 
compiled with gcc 4.x).
I would like to help in creating an opensource driver, but, despite I am a 
Linux senior system administrator, I have no experience at all at kernel 
programming.  Maybe I can help with some testing?
I don't know if someone tried it before, but what about a &quot;petition&quot; to TI for 
releasing the source of their driver? Anyone knows a mail address to write 
to? 
On <A HREF="http://www.webcon.ca/~imorgan/tifm21/">http://www.webcon.ca/~imorgan/tifm21/</A> I read that &quot;Christopher Baker 
managed to get a Linux driver for the device from TI, but only binary 
modules&quot;. How did he succeed? Who he contacted?
If TI has the sources of the driver (I am not sure about that, maybe the 
source are in the hands of Everest Inc.) it would be very useful to have a 
binary version compiled with gcc 4, so it is possible to do testing on recent 
distributions...

Best regards

LG
