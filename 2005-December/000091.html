<PRE>&gt;<i> Now, I don't think it makes sense to keep two separate projects for the
</I>&gt;<i> same thing. You are the only one working on it, and this confusion doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> help when it comes to possible collaboration. Paul Webster and Ian Morgan
</I>&gt;<i> had started writing code some time ago, e.g. I think what makes more sense
</I>&gt;<i> is merging the two projects. Which doesn't mean merging the code, IMHO, as
</I>&gt;<i> yours looks a very good starting point, and maybe something more than a
</I>&gt;<i> starting point. It means closing the tifm21 project and opening a new
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list related to the tifmxx project. It's up to you, giskard and
</I>&gt;<i> Paul Webster, i guess.
</I>
I agree, I had been &quot;examining&quot; the assorted objects of the binary
files found by Ian, but field work, a lack of experience in assembly
and just the time of year in general has meant that I haven't made
much progress.

&gt;<i> But I don't agree with some of the things you state on the wiki. Yes, in a
</I>&gt;<i> free world, reverse engineering wouldn't even be needed. I don't think we
</I>&gt;<i> live in a free world. See the Sklyarov case. Cleanroom approach is just a
</I>&gt;<i> method to avoid companies suing you. I'm collaborating at the bcm43xx
</I>&gt;<i> driver project following this method, not because I like it (even if it
</I>&gt;<i> works), but because I don't feel like Broadcom sue me. Even Compaq did
</I>&gt;<i> this with the IBM PC bios, BTW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, I guess you are just using the binary Linux driver for reverse
</I>&gt;<i> engineering purposes. That's GPL'ed, and it's not a problem at all to keep
</I>&gt;<i> it into the trunk. Reverse engineering it is legal, and what's not legal is
</I>&gt;<i> that TI doesn't release the source for it. But I can't understand why
</I>&gt;<i> you committed into trunk the windows binary driver. This is absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> useless and could lead to legal issues. Why?
</I>
After the whole Christmas thing, I'll give the tifmxx code a try and
see if I can contribute
