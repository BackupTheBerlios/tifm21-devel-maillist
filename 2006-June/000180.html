<PRE>I reworked the tifm_sd driver and bumped version to
0.5. Hopefully, the new code is better than old one
(old code's structure was copied from TI, while new
one uses compact state-machine implementation).

&gt;<i> after nearly half a year of discussing with texas
</I>&gt;<i> instruments about their binary driver i had this
</I>&gt;<i> night a phone conversation with guy from the
</I>&gt;<i> software department of texas instruments. 
</I>&gt;<i> they are working on a version to release a driver,
</I>&gt;<i> which is seperated in open and closed source code
</I>&gt;<i> with a independend HAL (not the best solution),
</I>&gt;<i> should be in the next weeks. 
</I>
The funny thing is that it's already clear (at least
to me) what their code does. What could be really
helpful is to get a datasheet for the damn device
(there are quite a few registers that are touched once
in the initialization, and the meaning of their values
is not clear). There's a chance that TI will release a
heavily documented driver, which will explain all
those values - unfotunately, the odds of this are
rather low.
