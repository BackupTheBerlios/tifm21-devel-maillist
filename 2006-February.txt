Subject: [Tifm21-devel] Status update ?
Message-ID: <43E20FF9.2090101@free.fr>

Hi all,

it's been a little while since someone posted to this list and I was 
wondering if anyone was still actively working on the project.

A few days ago I bought a new camera which uses SD cards, so now I'm 
able to test the driver. Which revision should I checkout? Who's working 
on what? Is there anything I should know since those last posts? Should 
I test something in particular?

Anyway, thanks to all for starting and working on this project :)

R?mi

Hmm.
Generally speaking I'm still working on the project,
but I had quite a busy month to make any real
progress. Please wait another revision or two before
trying out the SVN. I'll make an announcement when it
will be back in the working state.

Hi, I'm wondering what the current status of the driver is ? And in
which areas can I help. I can read assembly quite good if someone can
coordinate me where to start working.

hello Benjamin,

i think you must talk to Alex Dubov, as far as i know he is the only guy
who is writing code for the tifm21 chipset.

Alex, could you write a sort of ChangeLog?

I need around  a week more to round up my changes. I
mostly finished the assembler work for MMC/SD, but I
will need some help with scsi, probably.
I did no work yet on XD/MMS (this requires
disassembly) because I want to see something working
at all first (insertion/removal works and metadata
reading is nearly finished; I'm much less sure of
read/write).

If you want, peek at the SVN and tell me what you
think of it.

Well I tried latest svn and was able to get it to notice
if my memorystick was inserted or not. I get this:

Feb  7 11:59:32 saldana tifmxx: Got interrupt
Feb  7 11:59:32 saldana tifmxx: Bottom half
Feb  7 11:59:32 saldana tifmxx: MemoryStick card inserted, not supported

so everything seams to work as much as it should. I don't have
any other cards to try with, but I could get some if that would
help the development.

I tried revs 21 and 23 on a 2.6.15 kernel with Gentoo patches.

With 21 I had undefined symbols when loading the module, and with 23, it 
fails to compile :

Dear Intending partner,

This mail may not be surprising to you if you have been following current events in the international media with reference to the Middle East and Palestine in particular.
I am Mrs. SUHA ARAFAT, the wife of YASSER ARAFAT, the Palestinian
leader who died recently in Paris. Since his death and even prior to the announcement, I have been thrown into a state of antagonism, confusion, humiliation, frustration and hopelessness by the present leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the new Prime Minister. I have even been subjected to physical and psychological torture. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with everybody in the country at the moment.
You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the discovery of some fund in my husband secret bank account and companies and the allegations of some huge sums of money deposited by my husband in my name of which I have refuses to disclose or give up to the corrupt Palestine Government. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can 
visit the broadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about;
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3479937.stm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3995769.stm
I have deposited the sum of 20 million dollars with a private security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your bank account for safe keeping and any Investment opportunity. 
This arrangement is known to you and my personal Attorney. He might be 
dealing with you directly for security reasons as the case may be. In view of the above, if you are willing to assist for our mutual benefits, we will have to negotiate on your Percentage share of the $20,000,000 that will be kept in your position for a while and 
invested in your name for my trust pending when my Daughter, Zahra, 
will come off age and take full responsibility of her Family Estate/inheritance.
Please note that this is a golden opportunity that comes once in life time and more so, if you are honest, I am going to entrust more funds in your care as this is one of the legacy we keep for our children.
In case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security and international media as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith. Please expedite action and all response to my

I must say that this was the most original spam since
the first Nigerian one. Poor Yasser is probably

Subject: [Tifm21-devel] SD driver class?
Message-ID: <43EF60C4.5070902@eternach.de>

Hi guys,

i am new to this group an have an newbie question, maybe someone is 
willing to answer:

I have the following chip within my laptop:
06:06.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCIxx21/x515 Cardbus Controller
06:06.2 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments OHCI Compliant IEEE 1394 
Host Controller
06:06.3 Mass storage controller: Texas Instruments PCIxx21 Integrated 
FlashMedia Controller
06:06.4 Class 0805: Texas Instruments PCI6411, PCI6421, PCI6611, 
PCI6621, PCI7411, PCI7421, PCI7611, PCI7621 Secure Digital (SD) Controller


Some recherche turned out, that this is a multifunction-chip. It 
contains functions for:
1. PCMCIA (working with linux for me)
2. USB OHCI (not connected for my laptop, i have an additional one from ATI)
3. Flash Controller (no linux driver yet)
4. SD card controller (no linux driver yet)
4. 1394 (not sure whether driver s already existing)

Now following question: Look at the last line of the driver listing. 
linux doesnt even find a class for this kind of hardware. anyone knows 
whether linux already supports this class of hardware? Or maybe my 
kernel is way to old?

Untrue. See http://mmc.drzeus.cx/wiki/Linux/Drivers/sdhci . Now, things 
get a little more complicated in the TI case - the physical SD slot can 
be driven by either the flashmedia controller or by the SDHCI 
controller. In order to use the latter, you need to disable the former.

Hi Matthew,

thanks for your reply. But now im a bit confused now:

That means only the flash media support is missing, and the SD-support 
is already present?

In this case, couldn't we use the SD-driver as a template for the 
MC-driver?

Regards,
Andreas

That is correct. The SDHCI and Flash Media Controller are completely
seperate interfaces, as is the CardBus Controller and the IEEE 1394
Host Controller. While they both exist in the same chip, interface to
the PCI bus, and share the same physical sockets on most devices,
that's where the similarities end. Unlike the Flash Media Controller,
there is documentation available on the SDHCI, which has enabled the
development of a driver to progress successfully.

The lack of documentation for the Flash Media Controller, and the
complete unhelpfullness of TI has meant that attempts to create a
driver for the interface have had to resort to de-compiling either the
windows drivers (potentially a breach of licensing agreements of the
OS) or the TI binaries that have appeared, which are apparently GPL
anyway.

Having said that, there is work being done on the Flash Media Controller here:

It seems, SDHCI interface is present in devices 8034
and 8035, but not in 8033 (which I have) or 8031/803b.
Can anybody comment on this?

Not really - the hardware is pretty different. On the other hand, the 
tifmxx driver probably ought to be integrating with the mmc layer in the 
kernel for the sd slot - at the moment, it looks like it's duplicating 
existing code, which means it's unlikely to be merged.

yes, i'm watching (and testing) this driver on my  Texas Instruments PCIxx21 Integrated FlashMedia Controller with lspci -n
0000:06:09.0 0607: 104c:8031
0000:06:09.2 0c00: 104c:8032
0000:06:09.3 0180: 104c:8033
0000:06:09.4 0805: 104c:8034
lspci
0000:06:09.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCIxx21/x515 Cardbus Controller
0000:06:09.2 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments OHCI Compliant IEEE 1394 Host Controller
0000:06:09.3 Mass storage controller: Texas Instruments PCIxx21 Integrated FlashMedia Controller

the most important thing is, that normally per default the flashmedia controller is activated and not the sd controller. as you can only use one at a time it is necessary to activate the sd part with  'setpci -s 09.3 4c=02', then it works without any problems. please read http://list.drzeus.cx/pipermail/sdhci-devel/2005-November/000036.html too, as the byte in the pci register my differ (i have a aopen barebook) and you just have to set bit 2 of 4c.

Thanks for the info. For some reason I can't contact
list.drzeus.cx (some network problem). I, however,
figured the solution from TI's implementors guide:
setpci -s 06:09.0 86.b=90:d0
(that is toggle bit 6 of register 86; bit 2 of
register 4c is supposed to disable MMC/SD flashmedia
interface). I had to force bus rescan using fakephp
too.

By the way, there is not much effort duplication in my
tifmxx code. As of now, it only contains pci
initialization and all kinds of hw access functions
for flashmedia MMC interface. When I started it I had
not a slightest idea on the code structure of TI
driver, so integration with MMC code seemed too
far-fetched (I could not identify access primitives
before rewriting of considerable amount of code).

Does anybody know what benefits can I get from
integration with MMC layer? Yes, it implements MMC
access state machine and common primitives, but those
hardly account for 20% of my MMC reveng code. I'm even
assuming that SDHCI will do a better job of accessing
SD cards, but it can not serve as a base for MS or xD
support, can it?

Interesting. All the hardware I've seen with the controller has had the 
sdhci function visible at all times. What sort of machine do you have?

Using the generic mmc code means that any improvements in there 
automatically apply to the TI driver - there's recently been code added 
for MMCv4 support, and there are some patches for supporting the MMC 
password specification. However, as you suggest it doesn't provide 
anything terribly useful for MS or xD. Ideally we'd have separate 
protocol stacks for those as well, just in case anyone figures out how 
to drive any other controllers, but I can imagine that that's not a 
short-term goal.

Hello,

I'm requesting the developer of tifmxx projet to please move the files
of the current linux drivers into a subfolder, because I want to use
subversion in order to get the files (svn co
svn://svn.berlios.de/tifmxx/trunk ) and it's pretty annoying to get all
files withing ur cvs to get just some files that are needed in order to
compile...

Thank you..

Two things:
1. My machine:
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_Gentoo_Acer_Ferrari_4005WLMi_Manual#Hardware
(the dump is made with older pci.ids, but this does
not matters)

2. Different protocol stacks for different cards can
be good idea, but how exactly it applies to x-in-1
solutions? Driver that can talk to 3 or more different
subsystems will not be a pretty sight. To my
understanding, much better idea is to talk directly to
storage subsystem (scsi or whatever - not that anybody
wants to have many kinds of block devices anyway) and
have a support library of frequently used primitives.
After all, you can never know what wacky protocol
extension vendors will throw on you next.

3. Unrelated. I will move driver files into some svn
subdirectory later.

There's already plenty of drivers that speak to multiple subsystems :) 
But more reasonably, integration with the MMC layer isn't hard - a 
typical MMC/SD driver just has to:

1) Set the hardware capabilities
2) Register some callbacks (one to receive information from the MMC 
system, one to perform MMC requests and one to check whether the card is 
read-only or not)
3) Be able to set the MMC hardware up as the MMC layer requests

That way you benefit from any improvements in the MMC protocol stack 
without having to implement them again. There's a strong shift in the 
kernel towards using generic protocol stacks and fairly thin drivers - 
see the discussion about adopting an 802.11 stack rather than leaving 
one in every wireless driver, for instance.

For the xD and MS stuff, there's much less of an argument at the moment. 
We don't have anything in the kernel that drives them.

Date: 15 Feb 2006 15:46:23 -0600

Texas Instruments at this time does not have any plans to release a Linux
driver for this chipset or provide the source code so that others may
write drivers. OEM's that manufacture devices based on the ACX100 must
sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) and abide by the terms of this
agreement regarding driver support. TI will continue to monitor inquiries
regarding Linux driver requests for the ACX100 and in the future may
change its stance on driver support.

Thank You,

Karen Fischer

Subject: Ethics Office Inquiry: linux driver for the PCIxx21 flashmedia
controller



Hello, TI support,

**** Warning - this emailed link looks suspicious to me.  Is it a virus
scam?   DR ********

This inquiry was received in the ethics office hotline, but not via the
Accounting and Audit Hotline.

Would you be able to help Mr. Schneebacher?   I don't think this is a TI
product question.

The Linux question may need to be directed elsewhere.

Please let me know when this has been resolved. I will close my case on
it.  A copy of a final email exchange with the inquirer would be
sufficient for my files. Thanks again.



Regards, DR
Director, TI Ethics and Compliance

Subject: linux driver for the PCIxx21 flashmedia controller

hello!

i'm owning a notebook with the PCIxx21 integrated
pcmcia/firewire/flashmedia/SD controller, and i like to use it.
please could you send me (or provide it via your home page) the source
code of your linux driver for the flash media controller?

please note, as you provide the binary driver under the gpl and you are
including gpl code (at least include/linux/bio.h from the linux
sources), you should provide the source code (GPL licence, par. 3).
also, concerning the GPL par. 6 you should include the licence with your
binary driver too.


filename: tifm.ko
license: GPL
vermagic: 2.6.11.6 preempt PENTIUMM gcc-3.3
depends:
alias: pci:v0000104Cd0000AC8Fsv*sd*bc*sc*i*
alias: pci:v0000104Cd00008033sv*sd*bc*sc*i*
parm: major_num:int

(as i don't want to increase the size of the email, i put the driver on
my private site: http://zorn.mur.at/masc/ti-binary-driver.tgz )

thanks for your help,
...martin.schneebacher.

While slighly off topic, I suppose many people will
find this useful.

Some machines with TI chip don't have SDHCI enabled by
default. To make use of Pierre Ossmans driver on such
machine, I compiled a following walk-through:
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HARDWARE_Gentoo_Acer_Ferrari_4005WLMi_Manual#SDHCI

It was not too hard, yet somewhat non trivial to come
with this solution. Hope it helps.

hi!

the first response i forwarded to this mailing list seemed to be a fault of TI, because they were responding for the ACX100 (see it to late), so i pointed to this wrong hardware and asked (again) for the sources of the flashcard driver. this was their answer:

i haven't asked for the driver/source of the ACX100, but for the PCIxx21
flashmedia/sd integrated controller series.
