nice work!

Now that we have an official site for this project (at Berlios), I
think we should find a way to put all the information together. I
think that Berlios offers a wiki page for each project. It would be
interesting to put everything there, so that everyone can expand it
with his own knowledge or tests.

It would be nice to begin posting lspci and memory dumps in a common
place. Some suggestion?

Regards,

Jordi Vilalta

i don't know how i can do it (berlios.de offers a wiki system per
project or i need to install one?)..

if you know more about this issue feel free to mail me in private so i
can give you all the passwords you need

same thing for people interested in the:
- web page 
- svn write access 

btw, thank you :)

Hiya,

I generally only get to spend about an hour or so on this project a
night (and sometimes maybe a couple of minutes during my work day ;P).
If you like, I can upload my work to berlios and keep the files
updated there, as I work on them.

> i don't know how i can do it (berlios.de offers a wiki system per

Not sure. I havent used berlios before.

I have a slightly different version of the tifm21 module that I wrote
myself, around the same time as Ian. I added parameters to disable the
different card interfaces (see my last post to sdhci list). These
probably want to be incorporated into Ian's work on berlios. If you
can grant me svn access, that'd be great.

Thanks

Paul W

Hi,

What is the status of the development of the driver, is there something i could do except do a dump?

Thanks

at the moment we are "cleaning" the source code i think today or at last
tomorrow we will put a *working* copy of the driver on the svn.

btw, on what you are interested in?(ex write code,
maintain the site, reverse engineering,  $something_else) 

feel free to do what you thik useful for the project :)

Tonight (UTC+10). It won't do much other than allow you to take memory
dumps of the configuration space, and set/clear the bits to disable
the Flash Media interface's control of the different card slots. This
is useful on some implementations of the tifm21 chips if you're
wanting to test out the sdhci driver from Pierre. I'm still working on
reverse engineering the windows driver, since there is scant
information on the TI chips themselves.

Regards

...the initial basic driver has been checked in to SVN!

This driver isn't very flash and doesn't currently do much, but will
at least allow the disabling of the SD/MMC socket in the flash media
controller for those having problems testing out the sdhci driver for
the same chip.

I guess I should put together a README now...

Before this attempts i get two hard lockups.But at that time the old version 
of the driver was loaded.I removed it and inserted the new one.No problem 
occured.But when i try to remove the module machine locked.(X freezed,and 
Caps Lock key blinking,had to shut down the notebook with pressing the power 
button)

I use Slackware 10.2 ,Linux 2.6.14-ck5

It would depend on how your PCI bus is wired and configured in BIOS I assume.

Hi,

Looks like something else is sharing the interrupt assigned to the
driver (IRQ16 I think from your previous logs)

Subject: [Tifm21-devel] legal issues
Message-ID: <44821.st3.1133133168.squirrel@mail.riseup.net>

I'm very interested about this project, and I'm willing to help. But I
think there are some urgent legal issues going up with the driver
development. I already had to deal with this - I'm a developer from the
bcm43xx Linux Driver project - this way I understood how it's important
not to overlook legal issues in these cases.

Here goes the matter, this is pasted from a random EULA the windows driver
is distributed under:

3. Reverse Engineering. You agree that you will not attempt, and if you
employ employees or engage contractors, you will use your best efforts to
prevent your employees and contractors from attempting to reverse compile,
reverse engineer, modify, translate or disassemble the Software in whole
or in part. Any failure to comply with the above or any other terms and
conditions contained herein will result in the automatic termination of
this license and the reversion of the rights granted hereunder to TAIS.

Who distributes this software (e.g. Toshiba) could (and very probably
will) sue you as you have infringed this clause.

We solved this with cleanroom approach, more information about can be

I propose that the tifm21 project will just deal with the driver
development, and people who is interested in reverse engineering:
1) immediately stops contributing to the project (no code, no problem)
2) unsubscribe from this project and stops accessing to any repository
3) open a new project elsewhere (on berlios, too) with a different name
(e.g. tifm21-specs), dealing with _documentation_ about the device, which
can come from disassembling, testing, anything you want.

The tifm21 project will then write code based on these specifications.

If you accept my proposal, I'll join this project. I know that it can
sound quite weird, I come here and say you must split the project, but I
really think this is required for further development. As a matter of
fact, Broadcom is monitoring closely our project
(http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/) progress. Evidence of this is they removed
some features from the driver that were exploited by reverse engineers
(http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net) in order to understand their code. I
think that with TI thinks can get even worse, so please fix this issue
while you can, not any later.

i agree with this proposal
i'm going to take the following steps, if everybody involved agrees:
1) remove from the project any people involved with reverse engineering
2) remove from project pages any reference, even not direct ones, about
reverse engineered code
3) publish, as soon as somebody creates it, a link to the new
documentation project

I agree that this is probably an issue and am willing to submit to it.
The code I have provided on the project thus far is completely
independant of my reverse engineering attempts and does nothing more
than enable the device on the PCI bus and write to PCI registers
documented in the datasheets freely available on Texas Instruments
website.

As I have been looking at the assembly code in an attempt to identify
how to actually use the device, I am probably considered tainted by my
experiences, and shall remove myself from the tifm21 project. I
believe all files related to the reverse engineering of the driver
have already been removed from berlios, and I have also removed the
same files from another personal site that I was using for storage.

Stefano, regarding your assistance, are you looking to help with the
reverse assembly and documentation or the development side of the
project? Also, since I will not be able to contribute code for this
project, I would also like to assist with your Broadcom project, as my
laptop also contains one of these chips.

Another thought is if we're going to seperate the development of the
driver this way, it might be possible for someone involved in the
documentation side of the project to sign an NDA with TI in exchange
for proper documentation perhaps.

No.
As far as I understand project development is just delayed, since the
people who have the most knowledge about the chip have to decide if they
are providing documentation or provide code.
It's just a legal problem with reverse engineering. The project has to
be split up into
1) Documentation
2) Driver Development

You may not contribute to both projects and it is not clear whether it
is legal to use documentation from the documentation project, if you
know that the documentation is provided by means of
disassembling/reverse engineering.
So you have to decide...

but the project seems not to be halted!

Greetings,
Andreas

I'm willing to help on the development side, as I don't have any
experience of reverse engineering. About the Broadcom project, you can
join the development mailing list and see the current code in the svn
repository, both things are linked from http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/. If you
want to help out with reverse engineering, you should join the irc channel
#bcm-specs at irc.sipsolutions.net (port 1994 for ssl).

I already thought about this and tried contacting TI, but I got no useful
results so far.

Hello!

I would like to assist in driver development. I got a Flash-reader with
the device identification.

i haven't written a Linux driver yet, but i know C and i have assisted
in developing an iptables module, so i'm not a complete Linux kernel
newbie. So if i'm of use - i would like to assist by writing code and
getting that crappy little thingy running.

Hi,

I saw the concerns about the documentation from TI covering only the PCI
interface of the flash reader.

But according to the PDF it seems that for instance, the SD/MMC
controller is standard, no ? Shouldn't it be compatible with:

... or do I miss something ?

The SD/MMC reader appears to be usable in two modes. In one, it's an 
SDHCI compatible device and should work with Pierre's driver. In the 
other, it's driven via TI's custom interface. The flashmedia controller 
can also provide XD, smartmedia and memory stick support and those 
/aren't/ provided via a standard interface, so it's desirable to have a 
driver for those in any case.

No, they can simply refuse to provide it and risk copyright violation 
suits. However, it's likely that they'd have difficult arguing against 
you providing reverse-engineered code based on that driver.

Good job. Yes, I think it'll be difficult and it's unlikely that this will
succeed. I'm getting in touch with EFF. But I think it's worth a try to
politely asking them for the source, before.

About disassembling, did he get those with an EULA? This would be quite
ridicolous, actually. Anyway, I think we are now absolutely free to do
what we want with that binary, so it makes no sense at all to split the
project. A quick objdump -d on it shows they didn't stripped function
names. (It was compiled with GCC: (GNU) 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-8) =)

They did even included:
include/linux/blkdev.h
include/linux/bio.h

This is good. Thanks to all involved.

I'm amazed anyone managed to get anything from TI. I've been trying to
illicit a response from both TI and Everest for months now and have
had no luck aside from an initial, next-day reply from TI saying "Ask
Everest". Despite their rapid response, it was less than helpful, not
to mention rather insulting as it was a blatent copy of a forum post
regarding the driver that I had actually made myself.

On the supplied binary, I havent had a chance to test it yet, but my
understanding from both everest's site and other sources is that
Everests device driver does not create a standard block device and
consequently requires a daemon to work.

One thing to note: modinfo tifm.ko says that the license on the driver
is GPL. I'm not an expert, but doesn't that mean that someone has to
release the source code that was used to make that particular driver
somewhere?

Regardless, as we now have "viable" linux drivers as a reference, I
can drop my attempts at the decompilation of the windows version. I
was fumbling in the dark anyway, since assembly is not my thing
(hadn't done any since the MC68HC11 in Intro to Microprocessors at
uni).

i don't know if this would be reasonable but maybe anyone (involved) should send a note to http://gpl-violations.org/ ?

Are you certain on this? My reading of the information from Everest's
website[0] though suggests that the daemon is only used for card
insertion notification events to the user (plus it can do some flashy
automagical mounting/ unmounting on insertions and removals, but still
superfluous).

The module should, from Everest's description, be a block device driver
that covers all the access to the cards in the card reader?

This driver certainly provides 4 block devices.
