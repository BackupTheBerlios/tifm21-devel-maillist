</I>I used the svn version. However, the process often stalls, and what is
worse is that now when I try to copy files to the sd card, the konqueror
does not see correctly the free space on the card. So, now I suppose
will have to format the card.
About the sync/async, I don't know how to do it. SuSE's way of hanling
the storage medias are something not very clear for me. Now I have in
/etc/mtab the line: /dev/mmcblk1p1 /media/NIKON_D50 vfat
rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,flush,uid=1000,utf8,shortname=lower 0 0 added by
some demon when I have inserted the card.
