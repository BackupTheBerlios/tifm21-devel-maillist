Ahh.. yes. unless you copy the tifm drives into your kernel tree, then depmod has no idea it must 
load mmc_block when you load tifm_sd. So yes, just put mmc_block in your /etc/modules and mmc_block 
will pull in mmc_core when it loads.

I copy the modules to /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/misc/ and issue a depmod -ae, which causes 
loading tifm_sd to pull mmc_block in when it loads.

If the card is mounted async then you could copy 100MB to the card almost instantly and it will sit 
dirty in cache writing out as fast as the hardware allows. So yes this can happen. You could edit 
your fstab or however your distribution does it to mount the card -o sync (which is ugly if you have 
a fat formatted card) or just make sure you wait until the unmount completes prior to popping the 
card out (or things get very ugly, very quickly).

If you have a version of the driver that is older than about a week, the write speed is terrible. If 
you use the latest driver from SVN then it goes like a bat out of hell and is the &quot;greatest thing 
since sliced bread&quot; (tm). (which causes one to wonder what was the greatest thing prior to sliced 
bread).
