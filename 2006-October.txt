Hi all,

I found this tifm21 project yesterday and it seems to work almost perfectly. It
took a little time and effort to dig the right driver source code and
information but luckily it was worth it. Perhaps the front page needs also the
tifmxx svn source tree that everybody could easily find and try it too? It's
the working main project anyway, isn't it?

Well, back to the driver. I have the same Mass storage controller: Texas
Instruments PCIxx21 Integrated FlashMedia Controller as many others here seems
to own. Writing speed was a little above 700kB/s and reading speed was
something like 5MB/s for my 64MB MMC card. With tifm_core, tifm_7xx1 and
tifm_sd loaded as external modules there were no any other problems except the
tifm_sd module doesn't come back nicely from suspend. If a card is inserted
after suspending the machine while tifm_sd was loaded my keyboard stops working
and all other operations slow down greatly as well. This won't happen if the
module is removed before suspending the computer. After that it can be loaded
back and I can continue using my card reader as nothing had happened.

The debug messages for the tifm_sd after resuming from suspend and inserting a
mmc card:

Thanks for your great effort, I hope we see this driver in the main kernel some
day. Sadly there isn't much I can do to help you with.

I unload/reload the modules around suspend, the driver does not cope with suspend/resume.

brad at bklaptop2:~$ cat bin/tifm_load
#!/bin/bash
modprobe tifm_core
modprobe tifm_7xx1
modprobe tifm_sd

brad at bklaptop2:~$ cat bin/tifm_unload
#!/bin/bash
if [ -n "`mount | grep mmc`" ] ; then
         echo Need to remove card or unmount device 1st
         exit 1
fi;
if [ -n "`lsmod | grep ^mmc_block`" ] ; then
         if [ "`lsmod | grep ^mmc_block | awk '{print $3}'`" -ne "0" ] ; then
                 echo mmc_block ref count not 0 - not removing driver
                 exit 1
         fi;
fi;
rmmod ./tifm_sd.ko || true
rmmod ./tifm_7xx1.ko || true
rmmod ./tifm_core.ko || true

It's in -mm now and working nicely

It's in the kernel from 2.6.19-rc1 and working... somehow ;-)
It messes dmesg output and fails when i swap a few cards but its
on the best way to be great.

I probably need to make some clarifications:
1. I'm working on MemoryStick support for TI controller, but it's not compatible with ENE one.
There also exists support for winbond memorystick controller, but it's not compatible either. Bad
luck with this one.
2. Suspend/resume functionality is not my priority at the moment. It's probably broken and will be
fixed some time in the future.
3. Other problems: I'll appreciate any bug report against 2.6.18 kernel. I don't currently have
any 2.6.19-rc installed, so I can't test those. It's not that fortunate, of course, but I can't do
anything about this at the moment.

Hi,

I've started writing the same driver as you did, but when you post it to
the LKML I realized that you are far ahead me ;-). I have the second
pci_id:

/* this line should go to the  include/linux/pci_ids.h */
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_TI_0x803B       0x803b

static struct pci_device_id ti_mcr_ids[] = {
        { PCI_DEVICE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_TI, PCI_DEVICE_ID_TI_0x803B) },
		{ }
};  

I'm using the lastest 2.6.19-rc2,
